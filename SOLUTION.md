# Solution Steps

1. Define the Ticket class to represent support tickets, with fields for id and description.

2. Implement the TicketProducer class, which implements Runnable. It produces Ticket objects and adds them to a shared BlockingQueue while a running flag is true.

3. Implement the TicketAgent class, which implements Runnable. Each agent thread takes tickets from the shared BlockingQueue and processes them. Processing includes simulating possible failures and demonstrating error handling.

4. In the TicketingSystemMain class, set up shared data: an ArrayBlockingQueue for tickets (with limited capacity) and an AtomicBoolean 'running' flag.

5. Start one producer thread for simulating ticket arrivals.

6. Start multiple agent threads that consume and process tickets from the queue.

7. Let the system run for a fixed duration (e.g., 6 seconds) using Thread.sleep or a timer.

8. After the run duration, set the 'running' flag to false to signal all threads to shut down.

9. Wait for all threads to exit using Thread.join, ensuring a graceful shutdown.

10. Print log statements throughout to demonstrate ticket flow and thread lifecycle, including processing success and error handling.
